## Test Plan for ToDoList

### Objectives
ToDoList is an iOS/iPadOS app for task management. Users can use ToDoList to create, edit, delete tasks. There are also reminders enabled for user to pop-up notifications. The test plan covers testing stratgies and UI automatinon test cases for ToDoList.

### Testing strategies
We plan to cover UI testing with UI automation merged into CI. Testing scopes will be covered in the following section. Benchmark testing will also be covered in the UI automation so the team can track performance with builds. Be noted the app supports both iOS and iPadOS so the test sets will be separated into different groups to simulate behaviors on different platforms.

### Scope
Scope of UI test will focus on functionality testing to ensure all functionalies work as expected. Both iOS and iPadOS should be covered. Detail test case list will be delivered in test case list. Edge cases and boundary test cases will not covered in UI autmoation test but in manual testing. ![xmind map](ToDoList_XMIND.png)
